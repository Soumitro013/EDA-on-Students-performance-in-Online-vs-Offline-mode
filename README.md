When the recent pandemic was drastically transforming
our socio-economic acumen, the academia faced a prominent paradigm shift. The initiation of virtual classrooms,
whether a boon or a bane, is still a matter of debate for
many. Moreover, online evaluation systems have received
massive appreciation and criticism both at the same time.
In this study, we intend to investigate how flexible the
new framework is in granting decent grades. Moreover,
our motivation is to examine the notions of women emancipation in terms of studentsâ€™ adaptability at the face of
technological infusion. If such gender prerogatives are actually valid or not, can be deduced from the performance
of students during the online examination.
